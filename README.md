# Custom Calculator

Building a calculator in JavaScript was a great way to test my skills so here it is! The interface is really basic because my goal was to practice the logic not the design.

## How to run it

I'm using the Visual Code extension _[Live Server](https://ritwickdey.github.io/vscode-live-server/)_ to easily host the project locally.

Download it and follow the instructions to launch a server on the **index.html** page of the project.
